<h2>I'm going back to 505</h2>
<h2>If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive</h2>
<h2>In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs</h2>
<h2>Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck</h2>
<h2>Or I did last time I checked</h2>
<h2>Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark</h2>
<h2>Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark</h2>
<h2>The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start</h2>
<h2>I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive</h2>
<h2>In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs</h2>
